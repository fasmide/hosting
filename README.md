hosting - Yet another apache/mysql/ftp webhost creation util

It enables you to create webhosting for customers really quick - but you'll propperly need to rewrite/modify some of the classes to fit your specific needs

Its written in CoffeeScript and is intented to be used with nodejs

I'm using it with ubuntu server and the standard configuration of the packages libapache2-mod-php5 (this package automaticly selects apache +php for installation), mysql-server and pure-ftpd-mysql
